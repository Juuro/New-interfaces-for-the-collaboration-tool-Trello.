  \label{Conclusion}

In this thesis a Ruby-based API wrapper for the collaboration tool Trello was developed. Chapter \ref{apiwrapper} discussed its implementation and extensions to provide a convenient tool for developers to access Trello. With this API wrapper, developers can built every kind of script that works with data in Trello. A command-line interface was applied to the scripts to enable the developer to use the same script for multiple calls. Example scripts which use the API wrapper were described in chapter \ref{applications}. The first script exports Trello cards to an HTML file. Thus every kind of structured data file could be created with this approach. Two other scripts extract due dates of cards in Trello to Google Calendar or provide it as iCalendar file. To fill CMS with content stored in Trello a synchronisation script for the popular Joomla CMS was developed. Finally a backup solution is described to save all the information of a Trello account with organizations, boards, lists, cards, and its additions to a single file. This backup file is saved as ZIP and includes pure JSON. Thus it is easy to read for third party applications. The backup file can also be imported again in Trello.
