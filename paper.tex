\section*{Abstract}

Trello is a collaboration web service to manage projects and assign their to-do items to co-workers. There are many collaboration tools available today, but most of them are very basic. Nevertheless, it also has its limitations. Trello, as it is now, is a closed system. Nothing gets in or out unless Trello itself is used. It sometimes would be handy though, if it would be possible to apply Trello data to other applications. For example a CMS containing a list of posts which already managed in Trello.
 
Therefore, several scripts were developed for this thesis which let Trello interact with other web services and applications. To accomplish this task in the most dynamic way possible, an API wrapper of the Trello API in the Ruby programming language was implemented.\\[5mm]
