\section*{Abstract}

Trello is a collaboration webservice to manage projects and assign their todo items to co-workers. There are many collaboration tools today, but most of them are very basic. Trello is very extensive and it is optimal fo small businesses. But although it works fine like it's supposed to it has its limits. Trello as its state now is a closed system. Nothing gets in or out unless you use Trello itself. But sometimes it would be handy if you were able to get content from Trello out into other applications. For example a CMS which should contain completed theses which you are already managing in Trello.
 
So this thesis addresses small scripts which let Trello interact with other webservices and applications. For this purpose I wrote a wrapper of the Trello API in Ruby to accomplish this task in the most dynamic way possible.
