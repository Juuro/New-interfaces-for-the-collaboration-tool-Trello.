\subsubsection{Filename option}
The -n (or -name) argument for this script stands for the filename of the backup file which contains the  exported Trello data. With -n the user can specify a file to import. While processing the script first checks if the user has passed this argument. If not, it aborts. If the -n argument is given, the scipt proofes if the file is a ZIP file. For that it soesn't use the filename but the MIME type of the file.

\todo{listing design}
\begin{lstlisting}[float=htb, caption=Checking if the file has the MIME type \textquotedblleft application/zip\textquotedblright, label=listing008]
if `file -Ib #{@filename}`.gsub(/;.*\n/, "") != "application/zip"
	puts "ERROR: The backup file has to be a ZIP file!"
	abort
end
\end{lstlisting}

	
In line 1 the \texttt{file -Ib \#\{\@filename\}} is a bash call for receiving the MIME type of a file. Ruby executes it and with the gsub-Method it cuts the MIME part out of the received string. This shell script part in a ruby file is a bit dirty. But only for this small case it would be elaborately to use a seperate gem.
